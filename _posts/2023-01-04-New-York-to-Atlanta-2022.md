The [Philip Morris Headquarters](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) spire, a visual staple as you'd arrive on site heading to the Manufacturing Center, or the Technology Center on the banks of the James River... or passed by on your way to points further south, such as the Pre-packing factory in McKenny Virginia.

The roadsign exit to McKinney Virginia, spent more than a few weeks there, and almost getting run over by a forklift... twice.

Sorry for the pixelated image, but when your driving past on the way to bringing your son back to Atlanta at 80mph, it's a bit shaky.
