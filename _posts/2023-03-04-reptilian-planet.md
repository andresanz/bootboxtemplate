<div class="writing-prompt">
With heavy firepower, your crew has landed on a planet known to have hostile aliens that seem reptilian in their appearance. The terrain is comprised of swampland and the reptilian beings live underwater. You've put on a protective wetsuit and you're now leaving the ship to explore for the first time.

<div class="writing-prompt-body">
<p>We've been flying across this particular galaxy for years, with the ship's automation periodically wwaking us out of stasis to check the ship and each other.  No one ever mentioned that this included cleaning up people "output" when individual staisis tubes got it wrong, but such is the life of a sailor.</p>

<p>Our mission was a 10-year mission to map the galaxy known as EG103 to determine if it was worth sending larger  and more expensive contingencies to look for signs of... money.  Yes money.  Asteroids, moons ans ometimes planets have huge deposits of raw materials that the planet Earthdesperately needed.  Iron and other precious metals just get more and more precious.</p>

<p>No one expected to find any signs of life as humans know it, much less water.</p>
