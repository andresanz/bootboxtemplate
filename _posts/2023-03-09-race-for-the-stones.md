It is 1969, and you are one of the first astronauts to walk on the moon. As you take the first steps on the moon's surface, you and your crew discover stones with magical properties. You collect a few and take them back to Earth for additional research. The Soviet Union immediately sends a group of cosmonauts to the moon to gather their own source of magic. Tensions between Russia and the U.S. reach their peak, and a magical arms race ensues between these two superpowers.
